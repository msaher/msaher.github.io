    About me: I enjoy programming, metaphysical realism, forms, ethics, sociology, sincerity, and vim.
    I dislike materialism, nominalism, moral relativism, excessive irony, and emacs.
    I might sound formal or academic, but I'm actually pretty silly.

                <h2><a href="/writings/powerdsl/">Powershell? More like PowerDSL</a></h2>
            
            <p>I really tried to like Powershell. Despite coming from Unix, I was open to powershell&rsquo;s ideas like everything being an object. But after sometime with it I concluded powershell adds more friction than benefit.</p>
<p>Powershell&rsquo;s main novelty is having objects in a shell. But is this trade-off worth it? Especially when it entails allocating .NET objects all the time. Many important programs have stable outputs so adding structure everywhere is rarely useful. Even programs that might change their output like git have a <code>--porcelain</code> flag for programmatic consumption. Any serious tool you rely on for your infrastructure has a <code>--json</code> flag or similar. If it does not, that&rsquo;s a problem with the tool more than it is with the shell.</p>

                <h2><a href="/writings/why-ai-cant-be-conscious/">Why AI cannot be conscious</a></h2>
            
            <p>This essay is based on a report I wrote for my writing class back at university. It&rsquo;s even more relevant today in an age where investors genuinely think LLMs understand them and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/03/13/144721/a-startup-is-pitching-a-mind-uploading-service-that-is-100-percent-fatal/">startups want to help upload your mind</a>. Although no background in philosophy is needed, the writing style is more academic and assertive than usual because that&rsquo;s what the course wanted from me so I apologize in advance (at least my instructor said it was his favorite paper :p)</p>

The wizard book is considered a timeless classic that I will always hold dear to my heart for introducing me to computer science. It touches a lot of topics, making it a great introduction. Still, starting with functional programming is arguably less intuitive for most people. Most people don't care about purity (yet). Why would they?

                <h2><a href="/writings/the-procedural-reality-beneath-object-oriented-programs/">The Procedural Reality Beneath Object Oriented Programs</a></h2>
            
            <p>Many software engineers are taught object-oriented programming (OOP) with little regard to what the machine is actually doing - a common failure of university curricula. This in turn creates an attitude where a mere programming paradigm is treated as a divine abstraction offered to us by the deities who bestow us with programming languages.</p>
<p>I find that unacceptable. No abstraction is sacred. All object-oriented techniques can be mapped to procedural code with structs and function pointers. More engineers should be aware of this, and students, in particular, should not be shielded from this reality.</p>
